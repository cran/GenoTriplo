Description: Genotyping of triploid individuals from luminescence data (marker probeset A and B). Works also for diploids.
	Two main functions: Run_Clustering() that regroups individuals with a same genotype based on proximity and
	Run_Genotyping() that assigns a genotype to each cluster. For Shiny interface use: launch_GenoShiny().
